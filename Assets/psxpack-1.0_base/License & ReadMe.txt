=====================
Installation ########
=====================
Within the downloaded files you get two folders, "meshes" and "textures".
In case of Godot and Unity just insert those folders into your project and you are good to go.
With Unreal I have no personal experience, but it should not be much more difficult than that either.

The models use the Principled BDSF shader, but no PBR-textures to honor the limitations of PS1-technology.
Most models have a basic specular shine set.

For models with alpha values are materials provided (Godot only).
They should be working by simply inserting them alongside the according textures into your project.

=====================
Questions & Answers #
=====================
-- Why are you using .PNG's with baked in alpha? --
Because Godot can not, at least during my tests, read .TGA's with alpha channels.
Once I figure it out or it is fixed I will start converting textures into more appropiate Image formats, if applicable.

-- Can you provide .FBX and/or .OBJ-files? --
Yes and no. It was originally planned to release PSXPack with those filetypes including the source .BLEND-files.
However, I will provide them within the next updates.
